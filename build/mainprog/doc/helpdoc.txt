ASADT MARK II VERSION 1.0.3 HELP DOCUMENT

Execute: ./asadt.sh [-v] [-h] [-hh] [--updatecheck] [--scantool] [--exemkr]

 [-v]: Shows current version information, and a cool banner ;)

 [-h]: Shows the short help document

 [-hh]: Displays the entire help document on terminal using "cat" command

 [--updatecheck]: Checks the program version diffs against newer versions
                  using "wget" command. If an update is found, you will be notified on screen.
                  In the event that a user is updating, you may be required to remove the original script
                  folder from your desired install location to fresh install ASADT. This will require root
                  or sudo privileges.
                  DO NOT REMOVE THE USER REGISTRY KEY FILE, IT WILL BE UPDATED AFTER RUNNING ANY NEWER VERSION OF
                  ASADT'S BUILD SCRIPT.

 [--scantool]: Requires tool option post to setting this argument.
               Includes "nmap", "nikto", "dnsmap", "dmitry" & "assetfinder"
               to run a standalone scan, include the scan module name
               after setting the above argument. Ensure all module names
               are kept lowercase (ex. --scantool nmap)

               NMAP: We have attempted to integrate NMap's prototype NSE Script Scanning
               into ASADT. The NSE Script options within the Scantool WizGUI are represented
               as switches (0/1) that define what NSE Script Reference Type is to be used when
               running a NMap scan. The 1 switch represents table commands, such as "not intrusive"
               and the 0 switch represents using absolute method names like "default", "safe" etc.
               only place switches in the "NSE Type" field, and place the methods or table input into
               the "NSE Methods" field. Inputting multiple METHOD options will require the use of
               separatory commas (ex. safe,vuln). All input must remain lowercase.
               More information on this subject can be found @
               https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html

 [--exemkr]: Added in MII-v1.0.3, this tool combines ASADT with the already existent
             MS.F.P.C [Metasploit Framework Payload Creator] to generate both a MSF
             payload and a MSF payload handler for device exploitation and
             penetration testing. For more help with the settings of this tool,
             execute "msfpc -h"
