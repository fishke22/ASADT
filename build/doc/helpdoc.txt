    ASADT MARK II 1.0.1 HELPDOC

    Thank you for you interest in ASADT!
    Please Be Aware, ASADT is only in beta so expect potential bugs...

    MINOR UPDATES:

    FIXED ISSUES WITH "output_main" VARIABLE, AS WELL AS THE APPLIED PATCHES TO THE DNSMAP SCAN.
    ALSO ADDED KALI-DOCKER SUPPORT, "user=root" EXECUTION TYPES FOR THOSE ON SYSTEMS WITHOUT
    USER ACCOUNTS.


    Official ASADT HelpDoc For Version 1.5.3

    Current Shell Commands:

    sudo ./asadt.sh [-cnf] [-v] [-h] [--scantool] [--update]


    [-v]: Shows important release information, along with a cool banner 0_0

    [-h]: Prints this HelpDoc via "cat" then exits

    [--scantool]: As of ASADT "release-v152", ASADT now has a WizGUI! When Running a scan,
                  either enter the scantool module name (like "nmap" or "nikto" ) after setting
                  the "--scantool" argument. Alternatively, to run all available scan types enabled
                  in the default configuration by typing "wiz" after setting the "--scantool" argument.
                  For information on enabling and disabling scan modules, go to the
                  "To Edit The Configuration" section.

                  [nmap] - Currently Nmap offers [prototype] NSE Script Scanning
                           We have attempted to integrate this into our program. There are
                           two types of NSE script calls. We define them as "table" (new) or
                           "catagory" (legacy). To enable table mode, set the NSE Sript Type
                           to 1, or leave blank (0) to use catagory mode. leaving both options
                           blank with fault to the scan modules default options.

                           Catagories: auth,broadcast,brute,default,discovery,dos,exploit,
                           external,fuzzer,intrusive,malware,safe,version,vuln.
                           Please note: When entering these catagories, if entering mutilple, please
                           seperate via the use of comma's ",".

                           Tables: "not intrusive", etc...

                           More information on this topic can be found @
                           https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html

    [--update]: Checks for program updates on the cmd line.
                This tool requires active internet connection
                and the git-cli commands. These should've been
                installed during the build phase of ASADT's
                operations.

    [-cnf]:     For those concerned with code execution on their PC, running
                this command with the "progviewr" argument after, opens the progviewr
                function. This function allows for examination of all of the ASADT
                prog/program script, in case your concerned with how ASADT functions
                or operates; for your PC safety we guess 0_0. "progviewr.func" is also
                shown, for full transparency.

                "progviewr" can also show the contents of the default ScanTool configuration file.



    To Edit The Configuration:

    Navigate to the ASADT's root directory. If you need help locating this, users of release version 1.4.0 and above have a registry key file
    with program information in it. The userreg file usualy is located within the /home/"MYUSER" under the name .asadt. In cases when there is a failed
    installation or the userreg file isnt located in this area, please check for a backup one located at "/root/.asadt". Please note that the back up
    feature only exists on version(s) "release-v151" and above.

    WARNING: DO NOT EDIT THE USER REGISTRY FILE! IT IS A DEPENDENCY TO THE USAGE OF THE ASADT PROGRAM!

    To edit the configuration properly, please refer to our configuration guide below.
    shift+enter to make new table lines!
