## Description
A.S.A.D.T (Assistive Search And Discovery Tool) is a Bash (Bourne-Again Shell) Script. <br>
It's purpose is to provide an easier way to execute network scans with some of the most popular and advanced tools, obtain output, and relay information all in one package, at the same time remaining minimalistic, fast, and easy to use. The way ASADT Functions is by attaching wizards to various network scanning tools that are built in to the Kali-OS* (kali-rolling*), applies pre-defined configuration too the scan scripts, then executes the scan. No more confusing scan script commands or long inputs, it's simplified so all thats left to do, is scan! <br>
<br>
ASADT's pre-defined scan scripts attempt to gain the most out of all of the tools in our toolbox. If you believe one of our scan modules is out of date or could get even more discovery information, please let us know! <br>
